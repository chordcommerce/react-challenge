## Your Challenge

You are given a simple React app that contains a table of data. We would like
you to add some sweet new features.

We do not expect you to complete every requirement here, and you will have the
freedom to implement these requirements however you choose. We want to see how
far you can go and how you think about solving these problems.

You have been tasked with adding the following features:

1. Show only one month of data in the table at a time, with arrow buttons to cycle forward and backwards through the months.

2. Aggregate the values by week. You can choose any type of UI you think is best.

3. Create, update, and delete data points. You choose the UI again.

4. Display the data in a simple line chart, with the library of your choice. We recommend Recharts.

Some things to keep in mind:

1. Styles are not important here, we only care about functionality

2. You can use any libraries you like
